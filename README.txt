== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the tracking code placed within the head-tag and not right before the closing body-tag? =

The newer version of Google Analytics tracking code is known as the asynchronous tracking code, which Google claims is significantly more sensitive and accurate, and is able to track even very short activities on the website. The previous version delayed page loading and so, for performance reasons, it was generally placed just before the </body> body close HTML tag.
